What is Filter?
In signal processing, a filter is a device or process that removes some unwanted 
components or features from a signal. Filtering is a class of signal processing, 
the defining feature of filters being the complete or partial suppression of some 
aspect of the signal. Most often, this means removing some frequencies or 
frequency bands.
One way to classify filters is:-
 - Analog Filter
 - Digital Filter
Digital Filter
Digital filter is a system that performs mathematical operations on a 
sampled, discrete-time signal to reduce or enhance certain aspects of that 
signal. This is in contrast to the other major type of electronic filter, the 
analog filter, which is typically an electronic circuit operating on 
continuous-time analog signals. 
A digital filter designed to pass signal components of certain frequencies 
without any distortion should have a frequency response of value equal to 
one at these frequencies and should have a frequency response of value 
equal to zero at all other frequencies to totally block signal components 
with those frequencies.
There are four common types of digital filters:- 
- Low pass digital filter 
- High pass digital filter 
- Band pass digital filter 
- Band stop digital filter
lets see what Band-Pass filter is
 Band-pass Digital Filter
The ideal band pass digital filter has a unit magnitude response and zero 
phase response.
The filter passes the frequency components that are in a given frequency 
range and attenuates those frequencies outside the frequency range.
